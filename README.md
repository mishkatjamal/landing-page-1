#ðŸš€ Modern Responsive Website | HTML, CSS, Tailwind & SCSS

This project marks the beginning of my Full Stack Development journey! ðŸ’¡ I built this fully responsive website from scratch using HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and SCSS. Every line of code is written by me, ensuring a clean, structured, and well-commented codebase for easy understanding.

âœ¨ Features:
âœ… Neat & Minimal UI
âœ… Fully Responsive (Desktop-First Approach)
âœ… SCSS & @media Queries for Adaptive Design
âœ… Well-Commented Code for Better Readability

I truly enjoyed making this project responsive and refining the UI. This is just the startâ€”more exciting projects to come! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
